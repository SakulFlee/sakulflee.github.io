# University Project 1: Tickify, a web-store from scratch

The goal of this project was to implement an online shop from scratch.
Our task was to analyze the requirements, design and implement a fully working website, that sells event tickets for various concerts, theatres, and much more!

The website had to use PHP, HTML and CSS.
Though, we were not allowed to use JavaScript, any already existing library or styles.
Additionally, [Subversion] as a VCS, [Docker] for hosting and [Trello] for Agile-Scrum got utilized.

Our group got voted the best first year's student project!
